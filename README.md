# ToolBox

This app contains a Javascript calculator, \
a full stack MERN (Mongodb, Express, React, Node) Todo list \
and a weather app that uses metaweather API. 

I used the react hook useContext to provide the state to different components, \
for example, the weather icon shows the current weather of the location that is set in the weather app. \
the defualt img for the weather icon, as well as the other icon images, are sourced from https://pngtree.com
